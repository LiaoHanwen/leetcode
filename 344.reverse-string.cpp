 * Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an
 * array of characters char[].
 * 
 * Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying
 * the input arrayÂ in-place with O(1) extra memory.
 * 
 * You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii
