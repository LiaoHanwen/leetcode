 * Testcase Example:  '2'
 *
 * Given a positive integer n, break it into the sum of at least two positive
 * integers and maximize the product of those integers. Return the maximum
 * product you can get.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 2
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: 2 = 1 + 1, 1 × 1 = 1.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 10
 * Output: 36
 * Explanation: 10 = 3 + 3 + 4, 3 × 3 × 4 = 36.
 * 
 * Note: You may assume that n is not less than 2 and not larger than 58.

                Assuming that j+S corresponds to the optimal solution for maxArr[i], we have two cases:
                (1) i is the sum of two numbers, i.e. S=i-j is one number, and so maxArr[i]=j*(i-j)
                (2) i is the sum of at least three numbers, i.e. S=i-j is a sum of at least 2 numbers,
                and so the product of the numbers in this sum for S is maxArr[i-j]
                (=maximum product after breaking up i-j into a sum of at least two integers):
                maxArr[i] = j*maxArr[i-j]
                */
